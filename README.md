School management for schools or otherwise, is the creation, control, and conservation of pieces of information. Schools tend to develop an amazing array of documents, ranging from student papers and records of grades, attendance and behavior up through overall curriculum alignment and financial management.

## What are School Management Systems and How Can They Be Used in the School Setting?

School management systems can help free teachers and secretaries from the continuous process of filing documents, keeping track of them, and finding ways to communicate essential information to all members of the staff. Moreover, many school operations overlap. For example, attendance will not only affect events in the classroom, it also impacts lunchroom management and supply allocation. It will also influence state and federal money allocated to the school â€“ as do grades and yearly exam scores.
